				  				CryptREX is about maximizing profit and simplifying transactions. 
				  				<br>
				  				<br>We enable you to maximize your profits with our technology.
				  				<br>Think of us as a automated trading service, which allows you to buy at the lowest and sell at the highest in realtime across multiple exchanges. 
				  				<br>
								<br>If you are selling BTC for example, we will search all the major markets such as Cryptsy, BTC-e, Mt. Gox, to see which exchange has the highest current sell price and we will facilitate the whole transaction! 
								<br>
								<br><i>That means you only need CryptREX to trade across all exchanges.</i>
